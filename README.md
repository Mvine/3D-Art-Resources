# 3D-Art-Resources
No code in this repo, this is an active list of resources that I use and want to share with people who are looking to get better. As I find more things it will be updated!
<h1 style="font-size: 40pt;font-weight: bold">Tutorials / Lessons</h1>

## **Dylan Abernathy's Typewriter Course (free)**
- Dylan's take on the 3D pipeline inspired by Simon Fuchs iconic military radio series
- Gavin will give you this resource later probably if he hasn't already
- He works in Maya so things will be slightly different, but the concepts remain the same
- Dylan graduated from Durham college and has risen through the industry exceedingly fast, also a super nice guy

## **Simon Fuchs Military Radio Course ($35 USD - goes on sale)**
- This is one of the most iconic 3D tutorials ever and his workflow is industry standard
- I have gone through this course myself and I learned a TON
- Is 100% worth it at full price, but does go on sale often if you want to wait
- He works in Maya so things will be slightly different, but the concepts remain the same
- Simon is an industry vet, worked at Blizzard on Overwatch
- **There is an affiliate link in Dylan's tutorial above. I would also recommend using that link instead of this one if you purchase it.**
